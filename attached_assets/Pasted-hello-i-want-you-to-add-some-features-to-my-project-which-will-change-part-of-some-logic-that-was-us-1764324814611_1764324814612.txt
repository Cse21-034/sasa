hello i want you to add some features to my project which will change part of some logic that was used in my app, so in this app there are requesters(who post jobs so that they may be helped), providers(those who accept jobs to do the work), suppliers(companies that sell things which they will post their promotions and all), admin(verifies all users, manage the whole app, users and all). Now both requesters and providers can be individuals and can be companies as companies can provide services as well as seek for services same for individuals. Now currently my app logic was that when a requester posts a job, any provider who is in the same area as them can see the job and accept it if they want, so it is a first come first serve so whoever accpets the job first gets the job and the job will no longer be open for others then the certain provider will do the job and will now be able to message requester, get directions, set charge and be given the ability to change the job status. So now I was pitching the project to my client then he gave me an idea I want to implement, so hear me out so you can help me implement it,so this time when a requester posts a job let multiple providers be able to accept the job a maximum of 4 providers which will then accept and be directed to a waiting lobby for the job in which the requester who posted the job will be able to see the providers which accpeted the  job then choose whichever provider he wants in the lobby in which the provider now will be able to do the job, message the requester, get directions and all the things that I currently have. In the waiting lobby in the provider's side let it show that you are currently accepted the job wait for provider to choose which provider he/she wants. In the requester's side let it show all the providers that accepted the job along with names and numbers, profile picture, number of jobs completed as well as ratings so that the provider may choose on whatever reason she may be looking at.. Thats the implementation I want you to help me do so maybe you can use middleware to restrict providers who are in the waiting lobby to be able to do all the things of a accepted provider until they are chosen to do the job by the requester, use the same middleware which i used to restrict all users to do anything inside the app until they are fully verified, use the middleware to control the waiting lobby, I dont know just giving you an idea, you will see which idea is best to do then implement it. Also I added a new user recently which is a company which can be providers or requesters so verify that they can do all things eg if the company registered as a requester let it do all the things a requester does and if it is registered as a provider it does all the things a provider does, just verify that for me but i think its implemented just verify. You may start to do the requirments i asked you to do
