hello i want you to add some features to my project which will change part of some logic that was used in my app, so in this app there are requesters(who post jobs so that they may be helped), providers(those who accept jobs to do the work), suppliers(companies that sell things which they will post their promotions and all), admin(verifies all users, manage the whole app, users and all). Now both requesters and providers can be individuals and can be companies as companies can provide services as well as seek for services same for individuals. Now currently companies in signup cannot be signed up and they dont have the option either to sign up as a company which offers services or request services, also all requesters when posting a job(either individual or company) have the option in the job post to make the job available for individuals, companies or both so I want you to make sure that when requester clicks companies the job only appears to companies and when requester clicks individuals the job only appears to individuals and when they click both the job will appear to both parties. Also my job accepting logic which is supposed to allow multiple providers to be able to accept a job then the requester chooses whichever provider he wants to do the job,it works fine when the requester chooses a provider he/she wants to do the job, others cannot see it when there's one provider who already accepted the job I dont know maybe the browse jobs page is not filtering jobs properly or maybe its only showing jobs which are open and does not show jobs that are pending selection so please look into the issue and fix that. Also there's a feature i need to implement in my system whereby individual providers can apply for migration of location change, since when they signup they will choose the place they will operate eg a provider chooses Gaborone so when the provider moves to Molepolole it will not work for him since he will only see jobs in the initial place they chose while opening the account, so I want the app to be flexible and allow individual providers the ability to apply for a location migration request. maybe in their profile then the admin will either accept or reject the migration request then automatically after accepting, the location of the user will be updated in the database. Also make sure that companies who registered as providers do all the things individual providers do and companies who registered as requesters do what individual requesters do the only difference between them is that one is individual and the other are companies.
